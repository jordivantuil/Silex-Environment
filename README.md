# Silex Environment

A simple environment of Silex with pre-set routes, configs, a controller and Twig-view including the following packages:

- Twig
- Medoo
- SendGrid
- mPDF

I create a repository for this because I use this base a lot for new projects. Feel free to clone or download it and save yourself a lot of time :)

## Getting started

1) Clone this repository on your localhost or webserver, I don't mind.
2) Browse to the repository using your terminal `cd /path/to/repository`.
3) Install packages with composer `composer install` -or- `php composer.phar install`.
4) Create a MySQL database and update the credentials in `/app/config/config.yml`.
5) You're all set and ready to go!
